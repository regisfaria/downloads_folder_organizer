# Downloads Watcher


## Overview 
  This project is a way to automatic organize you'r PC download's folder.

  The code looks for PDF's, IMGs and Videos files in your Downloads folders and then move thoses to it's specifc location(IMG > Pictures folder, Videos > Videos folder, PDFs > Documents folder).

  So with this you will have a cleaner Downloads folder and if you have many files in your downloads folder, some files will be easier to find.

  !NOTE: the code don't run on windows yet. Maybe a to-do.

## Requirements
  I only use python3 and pip3, with watchdog python lib. It is all included in the installtion script, so you won't find any troubles with requirements.

## Instalation
  Just run ./INSTALL and it will install everything that you need to run the code and setup a crontab to run it everytime the system boots.
