# Downloads Watcher


## Overview 
  This project is a way to automatic organize you'r PC download's folder .
  I wish to create a code that will automatic move Pictures into your PC Pictures folder, and PDFs into
  a PDF folder in the Documents Folder.

  So with this you will have a cleaner Downloads folder and if you have many files in your downloads folder, some files will be easier to find.

## Actual Progress
Right now what I have is a code that already can move images and pdfs files into the destined folders.

Now I will need to now how to make a way that the code will be executed every time a new file is found in the downloads folder.(first i will look on how to do it on linux, after that i will focus on a windows version)
